This fork adds default-off offline quantization tooling: per-tensor quant error
reporting (`llama-quantize --tt-errors`), Hessian collection
(`llama-imatrix --hessian-dir`), GPTQ-style requantization
(`llama-quantize --gptq-u-dir`), and on the Radiance branch fused gate|up
weights and the MXFP4_RAD radiance-plane storage type. See
[CALIBRATION.md](CALIBRATION.md) for commands, env switches, and measured
results.

## RDNA4 Radiance MXFP4 prefill

The MXFP4 prefill GEMM is a port of [DeadCode's vllm-radiance](https://codeberg.org/StillDeadcode/vllm-radiance)
and its [libr4d](https://codeberg.org/StillDeadcode/vllm-radiance) kernel library, which run
vLLM on the R9700 (gfx1201 / RDNA4) through the fp8 WMMA tensor core. The idea it carries over is
that MXFP4 weights do not need an FP4 tensor core, because every e2m1 magnitude is exactly
representable in e4m3: expand the weights to e4m3 once and run the matmul on
`v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_fp8_fp8`. The kernels here were re-derived against `ggml-cuda` rather than
copied, since the upstream side is Triton/CUDA and this tree is C++/HIP, but the kernel
organization is the part that was ported.

### How it plugs in

`ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q_radiance()` sits at the top of `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q()` and takes the call
over only when its policy accepts the shape: type is `MXFP4`, the device is RDNA4, `M` (tokens)
`>= 256`, `K % 64 == 0`, `N % 16 == 0`, and all three operands are contiguous. Anything else
falls through to the existing MMQ/MMVQ routing untouched, so no other type, batch size or
backend changes behavior.

Three env switches are useful while tuning:

* `GGML_RAD_DISABLE=1` turns the path off, which is also how the A/B numbers below were taken.
* `GGML_RAD_PREFILL_MIN_M` moves the token threshold (default 256).
* `GGML_RAD_DEBUG=1` prints why a given shape was declined.

Three pieces do the work.

**1. One-time weight repack.** MXFP4 nibbles are not in an order the fp8 loader can consume, so
on first sight of a weight tensor `ggml_cuda_radiance_repack()` rewrites it into an e4m3 tile
layout: `W` is the packed e4m3 payload, `Ws` holds the E8M0 scales and `Wref` the reference
scale byte. The repack is size-neutral - `N*K/2 + N*K/32 + N` bytes is exactly MXFP4's
0.53125 B/weight - so it does not double the weight footprint, it only has to coexist with the
original tensor. Results are cached per weight pointer for the process lifetime.

The per-block exponent is folded into the weight at repack time, which is what removes the
per-32-block rescale from the inner loop entirely. That fold has to descend into e4m3
**subnormals** to stay exact: stopping at the smallest e4m3 normal makes it exact only while the
exponent spread `d <= 5`, and this checkpoint reaches `d = 10` (`mlp.down_proj` holds 11354 of
the model's 14433 out-of-range blocks). The truncated form zeroed 6.7% of the weights on 36
output channels of layer 58, for per-channel errors up to 18.7%. With subnormals every affected
layer with `d <= 8` is exact and layer 58 drops 4x to 0.31%.

**2. The GEMM itself** (`radiance_mxfp4_fp8_gemm_atiled`). TM=4, WM=4, WN=2 (256 threads, 4
waves), an N tile of 128, and `TN=4` once `M >= 2048` so the weight tile is amortized over more
columns. The weight tile is staged through LDS, while the activations are read straight from
global as A fragments and consumed only at the WMMAs. The inner loop comes out at 3.1
instructions per WMMA, 32.5% of them the WMMA itself - reading the weight tile once and reusing
it across the whole M tile is where the win over the generic MMQ comes from.

**3. Fused swiglu + per-token fp8 quant.** The GLU output feeds one MXFP4 down GEMM, which
would otherwise have to re-read `y` to quantize it. `swiglu_quant_fused_kernel` emits both the
f32 `y` and its e4m3 quantizate in one pass, and a device-side row hash lets a repeated call
skip requantizing byte-identical rows. The hash lives in device memory, so nothing here breaks
graph capture.

### Building

**There is no flag to turn this on.** `radiance-gemm.cu` is picked up by the backend's
`file(GLOB "../ggml-cuda/*.cu")`, the same way as every other kernel, and the source has no
preprocessor guard around it. The only build-time requirement is that the target list contains
an RDNA4 architecture:

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1201 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
```

`gfx1200` (RX 9060 XT) works too, and both can be listed together. **Do not put a non-RDNA4
architecture in the same list.** The kernels call the gfx12-only builtin directly, so every
target in `AMDGPU_TARGETS` has to compile the file, and a mixed list fails outright:

```
error: '__builtin_amdgcn_wmma_f32_16x16x16_fp8_fp8_w32_gfx12' needs target feature
       wmma-128b-insts,wavefrontsize32
```

On a machine with both an RDNA4 and an older card, build for the RDNA4 targets only. A build
made without an RDNA4 target does not compile at all, rather than compiling and falling back at
runtime.

At runtime the path is chosen per device: `ggml_cuda_radiance_supported()` reads the compute
capability of the device the op is running on and requires it to be RDNA4, so on a multi-GPU
setup only the RDNA4 devices take this path while the others keep their existing kernels. The
env switches listed above apply on top of that, with `GGML_RAD_DISABLE=1` as the way to switch
back to MMQ.

### Performance on Qwen3.8-27B, single R9700

`-ub 2048`, `-fa 1`, greedy:

| test | t/s |
|---|---|
| pp512 | 2290 |
| pp2048 | 2692 |
| tg128 | 29.85 |

Prefill is the point of the whole exercise. Against the MMQ fp8 WMMA path - which issues the
*same* `v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_fp8_fp8` on the *same* weights and differs only in how the kernel
is organized - the switch is one env var, so the comparison isolates kernel organization from
quantization:

| | pp512 | pp2048 |
|---|---|---|
| radiance on | 2205 | 2549 |
| radiance off (`GGML_RAD_DISABLE=1`, MMQ fp8 WMMA) | 1518 | 1650 |
| speedup | 1.45x | 1.54x |

That A/B was taken before the GDN and rms_norm work below, which is why its "radiance on" row
reads lower than the table above. Both rows come from the same session and the same binary, so
the ratio between them is what the comparison is for.

Measured against the instruction's own ceiling on this card (329 TFLOP/s peak in a standalone
microbenchmark), the radiance kernel sustains **252 TFLOP/s, about 77%** of what the fp8 WMMA
can issue. Its inner loop is 198 instructions per 64 WMMAs, 3.1 instructions per WMMA, so the
remaining gap is register pressure rather than address arithmetic.

### GDN chunked prefill and the rms_norm block width

Two further changes target the non-GEMM part of a prefill pass. Both are shape driven, so they
apply to any model with this layer layout rather than to MXFP4 only.

**The chunked GDN triangular inverse.** 48 of the 65 layers are gated delta net layers, and
their chunked prefill kernel was dominated by one block: a 32x32 unit lower triangular inverse
run by a single warp. Each lane wrote its own column of the inverse and then read every element
back out of LDS on the next row, so every term of the inner sum paid two LDS reads plus a write,
with `unroll 1` keeping the sweep rolled up. Holding the column in registers instead, splitting
the 16x16 diagonal blocks across two warps, and doing the off-diagonal block as one 16x16
product took the kernel from 23.8 to 10.3 us per chunk:

| | per forward, 48 layers | pp2048 |
|---|---|---|
| before | 73.1 ms | 2550 |
| after | 43.3 ms | 2668 |

**The rms_norm block width.** `rms_norm_f32` walks its row with
`for (col = tid; col < ncols; col += block_size)`, so a block wider than `ncols` leaves the
extra threads idle while still joining `block_reduce` and every `__syncthreads`. Two of the
three prefill instances run at `ncols = 128` with a 256 wide block, so half of each block was
doing nothing. Adding an `ncols <= 128` arm that launches the same template with 128 threads cut
the rms_norm total from 46.8 to 36.6 ms per forward pass, worth a further +1.1% at pp2048.

Together the two are worth **+4.7% and +1.1% on pp2048**. On perplexity (`--chunks 8 -ub 2048`)
the baseline is `6.9633 +/- 0.12494`; the GDN inverse takes it to `6.9517 +/- 0.12466`, a shift of
0.17% that sits well inside the error bar, and the rms_norm change then leaves it bit identical.
The register form of the inverse is exact, and only the blocked form moves anything: it reassociates
the diagonal solves and differs from the old code by 7.5e-9 on 140 of 528 entries, which is six
orders of magnitude below the bf16 resolution of the values that follow.

### DFlash speculative decode

Generation is llama.cpp's weak side on this model, so the prefill work is paired with a DFlash
drafter (`--spec-type draft-dflash --spec-draft-n-max 7 --temp 0`). The drafter proposes 7 tokens
per forward and they are verified in one pass, which is worth roughly 1.8x over plain decode:
`tg128` alone is 29.90 t/s, while the same card at `-ub 2048` with DFlash lands between 49 and
86 t/s depending on how predictable the continuation is:

| prompt | decoded | accepted |
|---|---|---|
| online softmax | 69.6 t/s | 231 / 488 |
| Python merge | 86.2 t/s | 253 / 381 |
| French Revolution | 49.1 t/s | 196 / 736 |

That spread is inherent to speculative decoding - the accept rate tracks the text, not the
kernel - so quote a range rather than a single number. The drafter is a separate small GGUF and
has to be quantized to the same scheme as the target.

### Supported quantization types

**The tuned prefill paths in this fork currently cover three weight types only - `MXFP4`,
`MXFP8` and `BF16`.** A model has to be quantized to one of them to benefit:

| weight type | prefill path | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MXFP4` | radiance, fp8 WMMA | the target of this work; engages at `M >= 256` |
| `MXFP8` | MMQ, fp8 WMMA | same instruction, generic MMQ organization |
| `BF16` | f16/bf16 WMMA (`mmf`) | unquantized baseline, already upstream |

Everything else - `NVFP4`, the `Q4_0` family, the k-quants - still runs its existing path and is
untuned here. The numbers above were all measured on `MXFP4`.

### Upstream Q2_K register spill on RDNA4, fixed here

The upstream MMQ config table (6eddde06a, "refactor MMQ kernel configuration") gives `Q2_K` a
maximum tile of J=80 with a 128 deep tile on RDNA4, and that kernel does not fit: 256 VGPR and
2128 bytes of scratch memory per thread. Every `Q2_K` GEMM therefore spills to local memory and
runs at 2.9 TFLOP/s while every other quant type on the same model runs at 68 to 167 - on a
mixed IQ3_S build of Qwen3.8-27B, 13 `Q2_K` tensors took 50% of one prefill pass. The
`llama.cpp-ROCm` and `llama.cpp-W8A8` checkouts show the identical numbers, this is an upstream
defect, not something introduced in this fork.

`Q2_K` carries two auxiliary quantities per superblock where `Q3_K` carries one, which is why the
128 deep tile does not fit. The fix adds half depth (I=64) tiles at J=96/112/128 and keeps the
old entry as the J=80 fallback; the J picker takes the config with the fewest column tiles, so
large batches now select J=128 with no spill at all. Measured on the same model, same session:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `Q2_K` per forward pass (13 calls) | 1020.1 ms | 130.2 ms |
| `Q2_K` throughput | 2.9 TFLOP/s | 23.1 TFLOP/s |
| scratch memory | 2128 B/thread | 0 |
| pp2048 | 820.3 | 1294.3 (+58%) |

`MUL_MAT` passes 708/708. Perplexity is bit identical (tile width does not change the K order),
and the MXFP4 radiance path does not dispatch `Q2_K` at all, so it is unaffected. The fix is
present on all three branches of this fork (`master`, `Radiance`, `llama.cpp-Pascal`), and
`Q2_K` still has headroom left - it now runs at 23 TFLOP/s against 68 for the slowest of its
peers, the half depth tile does double work.

## RDNA4 I4 W4A4 (weight 4-bit x activation 4-bit)

`Q4_0_ROCMI4` is a signed-nibble 4-bit format with a one-byte UE4M3 block scale
(32 elements per block, 4.25 bpw). On RDNA4 it has two compute paths:

* **W4A4 (prefill)** — weights stay packed as nibbles in LDS and are consumed by the native
  `v_wmma_i32_16x16x32_iu4` tensor-core instruction (K = 32 in a single op). Activations are
  quantized onto a signed 4-bit grid. Requires `-DGGML_HIP_ROCMI4_W4A4=ON`.
* **W8A8 (decode)** — the MMVQ path decodes nibbles to int8 and pairs them with q8_1
  activations, so decode keeps 8-bit activation precision. This is the default and is not
  affected by the build option above: at batch sizes up to 8 the activations stay q8_1, and
  only larger batches take the W4A4 path.

Enable W4A4 at configure time:

```bash
cmake -B build-gpu -DGGML_HIP=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1201 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DGGML_HIP_ROCMI4_W4A4=ON
cmake --build build-gpu -j
```

Quantize with the `Q4_0_ROCMI4` ftype; it reuses the Q4_0 per-tensor assignment, so the same
tensors are promoted to Q6_K and the resulting file size matches Q4_0's layout:

```bash
./build-gpu/bin/llama-quantize model-bf16.gguf model-rocmi4.gguf Q4_0_ROCMI4
```

**W4A4 is deliberately lossy on the activation side.** Prefill quantizes activations to a
4-bit grid (16 uniform levels) instead of the q8_1 used everywhere else, so a file built with
W4A4 enabled scores worse than the same file built with `-DGGML_HIP_ROCMI4_W4A4=OFF`. Measured
on Qwen3.8-27B, single R9700, `-c 512`:

| file | PPL |
|---|---|
| `Q4_0` (reference) | 3.7755 |
| `Q4_0_ROCMI4`, W4A4 off | 4.6937 |
| `Q4_0_ROCMI4`, W4A4 on | 5.4493 |

The same pattern shows up in decode without any build-flag change, because that is the same
trade-off reached from the other side: forcing a batch size of 1 puts prefill through the
q8_1 activation path and the same file then measures 4.7064.

For prefill throughput on a 1B dense model, single R9700, `-p 2048 -r 5`: `Q4_0` 25 049 t/s
against `Q4_0_ROCMI4` with W4A4 on at 29 588 t/s, i.e. about +18%, and roughly +14.5% at the
tile configuration shipped before the final one. These are dense-transformer numbers; the
27B figures measured later mix in SSM layers and are not directly comparable.

**Do not quantize `ssm_out` to `Q4_0_ROCMI4`.** (The same applies to `Q4_0_SYM4`; see the section below.) On hybrid SSM/attention architectures such as
Qwen3.8-27B, `ssm_out.weight` must be left at another type. Putting it in ROCMI4 drives
perplexity to ~4.3e5 while every other tensor in the same file stays correct, and it does so
identically on CPU and on GPU, so it is not a kernel defect. Pin those tensors to Q8_0 or
MXFP4 instead:

```bash
# one line per layer: blk.N.ssm_out.weight=q8_0
./build-gpu/bin/llama-quantize --tensor-type-file ssm_out.txt \
    model-bf16.gguf model-rocmi4.gguf Q4_0_ROCMI4
```

Both workarounds were measured on Qwen3.8-27B, single R9700, `-c 512`:

| `ssm_out` type | bpw | size | PPL |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Q4_0_ROCMI4` | 4.25 | 13.88 GiB | 429951 (broken) |
| `MXFP4` | 4.36 | 13.87 GiB | 4.3262 |
| `Q8_0` | 4.60 | 14.62 GiB | 4.4551 |

The damage scales with how many `ssm_out` tensors stay in ROCMI4 rather than coming from one
bad tensor, which fits the tensor feeding the SSM/gated-delta recurrence: a small per-layer
error enters a state carried across layers and tokens and compounds instead of washing out.
Pinning the first 24 of 48 layers to MXFP4 gives 274.2766, all 48 left in ROCMI4 gives
429951, and all 48 pinned gives 4.3262.

The root cause is not yet understood: the stored
`ssm_out` values are no less accurate than MXFP4's (NMSE 1.08e-2 against 1.31e-2 on the bf16
source), the standalone dot product is exact, and the failure reproduces bit-for-bit across
backends that use different activation precisions. Treat it as a known limitation of the
current ROCMI4 support rather than a property of the format.

## Q4_0_SYM4 — experimental symmetric 4-bit format

**`Q4_0_SYM4` is experimental. It is not a general-purpose replacement for `Q4_0_ROCMI4`, and
like ROCMI4 it must not be used for `ssm_out` tensors.** See the tuning rules below: used
indiscriminately it is *worse* than ROCMI4 on the metric that matters most, and only a
per-tensor assignment makes it a clear win.

SYM4 keeps ROCMI4's exact 17-byte block (32 elements, one UE4M3 scale, 4.25 bpw) and changes
only the code grid:

| format | decoded value | scale | reachable codes | step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Q4_0_ROCMI4` | `n * s` | `nearest_ue4m3(amax/7)` | 15 of 16 | `amax/7` |
| `Q4_0_SYM4` | `(n + 0.5) * s` | `nearest_ue4m3(amax/7.5)` | **16 of 16** | **`amax/7.5`** |

Because `|x| <= amax = 7*s`, ROCMI4's code `n = -8` can never be selected — one of its 16 codes
is wasted. SYM4 shifts the grid by half a step so that all 16 codes are reachable and the grid
is exactly symmetric, which makes the step 6.67% finer and the rounding MSE about 12.9% lower.

The cost is that 16 is an even count, so a symmetric grid **cannot contain zero**: elements
below half a step are forced onto `±s/2` instead of being represented exactly. On most weight
tensors the finer step more than pays for this, but not on all of them — hence the per-tensor
rules.

### Compute paths

Both paths exist, mirroring ROCMI4:

* **W8A8 (decode / default)** — the grid offset is folded into the data rather than corrected
  afterwards. Since `(n + 0.5) * s == (2n + 1) * (s/2)` and `2n + 1` lies in `[-15, 15]`, it
  still fits an int8 operand, so the loader emits `2n + 1` and halves the scale and ROCMI4's
  int8 kernels apply unchanged. The per-byte transform is `((v & 0x7F7F7F7F) << 1) | 0x01010101`.
* **W4A4 (prefill, `-DGGML_HIP_ROCMI4_W4A4=ON`)** — the `iu4` tensor-core instruction reads the
  LDS row as packed 4-bit nibbles, so the `2n + 1` trick is impossible (`2n + 1` needs five
  bits). The nibble stays raw and the offset is corrected in the vec_dot epilogue:
  `sum_i (n_i + 0.5)*sx*(m_i*dB) = sx*dB*sum_i(n_i*m_i) + 0.5*sx*dB*sum_i m_i`.
  The activation packer emits `sum_i m_i` into y-row ints 20..23, which ROCMI4's W4A4 vec_dot
  never reads, so the two formats share one activation buffer layout.

Quantize with the `Q4_0_SYM4` ftype. The file size is **byte-identical** to the ROCMI4 file for
the same per-tensor assignment, because the block layout is the same.

### Measured on Qwen3.8-27B (single R9700, `-c 512`)

KL divergence against the bf16 model, with `ssm_out` pinned to `Q8_0` in every configuration:

| assignment | Mean KLD | 99% KLD | 99% Δp | RMS Δp | Same top-p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| all ROCMI4 | 0.3200 | 7.604 | 37.26% | 14.66% | 86.42% |
| all SYM4 | 0.2932 | 7.683 | **80.17%** | 14.38% | 88.87% |
| **tuned SYM4 (below)** | **0.2173** | **4.605** | **30.61%** | **11.13%** | **89.71%** |

Read this table carefully: **all-SYM4 improves the mean but destroys the tail.** Its 99% Δp is
80.17% against ROCMI4's 37.26%, i.e. the worst 1% of tokens are pushed more than twice as far.
The tuned assignment fixes that and beats ROCMI4 on every column at once.

### Tuning rules

Enable SYM4 only for these tensor classes:

| tensor class | tensors | why |
|---|---|---|
| `token_embd` | 1 | by far the most important single tensor. Swapping just this one from ROCMI4 to SYM4 moves 99% Δp from 63.00% to 35.36% |
| `ffn_down` | 65 | the only FFN class that improves the tail: 99% Δp 35.36% → 30.63%, Max KLD 18.77 → 16.30 |
| `attn_output` | 17 | best single-class 99% KLD (5.742) and RMS Δp (12.245%) |
| `attn_gate` | 48 | best single-class Mean KLD (0.2522) and Same top-p (89.41%) |
| `attn_k` | 17 | good tail: 99% Δp 32.94% |
| `attn_q` | 17 | good tail: 99% Δp 31.59% |

Keep ROCMI4 for these:

| tensor class | tensors | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `attn_v` | 17 | adding it moves 99% Δp from 30.61% to **73.20%** |
| `attn_qkv` | 48 | adding it moves 99% Δp from 73.20% to **76.65%** |
| `ffn_gate` | 65 | adding it moves 99% Δp from 30.63% to **42.01%** |
| `ffn_up` | 65 | adding it moves 99% Δp from 42.01% to 36.82%, still short of the 30.63% without it |

The four harmful classes are individually small (`attn_v` is 45 MiB, `ffn_gate`/`ffn_up` 2.9 GiB
each) yet each one degrades the tail, so the rule is not "use SYM4 where it is large" — it has
to be applied class by class. `attn_v` and `attn_qkv` are the sharpest examples: they are the
smallest classes in the set, and they are the ones that break the tail worst.

Reproduce the tuned assignment:

```bash
cat > sym4.txt <<'EOF'
ssm_out=q8_0
\.ffn_down\.weight=q4_0_sym4
\.attn_output\.weight=q4_0_sym4
\.attn_gate\.weight=q4_0_sym4
\.attn_k\.weight=q4_0_sym4
\.attn_q\.weight=q4_0_sym4
EOF

./build-gpu/bin/llama-quantize --tensor-type-file sym4.txt \
    --token-embedding-type q4_0_sym4 \
    model-bf16.gguf model-sym4.gguf Q4_0_ROCMI4
```

Note the two mechanisms at work: `--token-embedding-type` sets `token_embd`, while
`--tensor-type-file` uses regex search against the tensor name, so the patterns above are
anchored on `.weight` to avoid also matching `attn_q_norm`, `attn_k_norm`, and the like.
`ssm_out` must stay pinned to `Q8_0` (or MXFP4) exactly as for ROCMI4.

### imatrix support

`--imatrix` works for `Q4_0_SYM4`, matching `Q4_0_ROCMI4`. SYM4 has one free parameter per
block (the UE4M3 scale) and the codes follow by rounding, so the weighted path searches for the
scale that minimises the importance-weighted error instead of taking `amax/7.5`. Two constants
differ from the ROCMI4 variant because SYM4's grid tops out at `7.5*s`: the search starts at
`amax/7.5`, and the early-exit clipping bound uses 7.5.

**A full imatrix is not necessarily the best choice, so tune it against KL rather than assuming
it helps.** On Qwen3.8-27B the weighted path moved error from the typical token to the worst
one: the average-weighted metrics all improved (Mean KLD −4.7%, 95% KLD −11.3%, 95% Δp −12.8%)
while the 99th-percentile metrics got worse (99% Δp +10.8%, 99% KLD +3.8%). Which side of that
trade matters depends on the use. Under llama.cpp's speculative decoding the accept test is
whether the target's sampled token equals the draft's proposal, so what counts is agreement on
the top of the distribution — `Same top-p` and `99% Δp` — rather than `Mean KLD`, which averages
over the whole 248k-token vocabulary. For a draft model the 99% figures are the ones to watch.

No single tensor class causes the tail cost, and masking one does not recover it: removing the
imatrix entries for a class makes that tensor fall back to the unweighted quantiser (the loader
leaves the pointer NULL when a name is missing), and doing so for `attn_v` + `attn_qkv`,
`ffn_down`, `ffn_gate`, or `ffn_up` each made 99% Δp *worse* than the full imatrix. The
tail cost is a property of the weighted objective, not of any one class. Note also that
`ffn_up` scored the best `Same top-p` while having a poor 99% Δp, so those two metrics can
disagree — measure both, and do not trust differences below about 1pp, since these were single
runs whose spread has not been characterised.

### Cost

None measurable. On the tuned file, single R9700, `-p 512 -n 128 -r 3`:

| file | size | pp512 | tg128 |
|---|---|---|---|
| all ROCMI4 | 14.62 GiB | 1370 ± 401 | 28.52 ± 0.15 |
| tuned SYM4 | 14.62 GiB | 1338 ± 397 | 28.53 ± 0.18 |

Same size (byte-identical), same decode throughput; the prefill difference is well inside the
run-to-run spread. The gain is therefore pure KL improvement at zero cost.

### Status

The tuned assignment above was measured on Qwen3.8-27B only. The direction of each class was
consistent across repeated runs, but the harmful-class result (`attn_v`, `attn_qkv`) is not yet
explained mechanically — both feed the attention value path, yet `attn_k` and `attn_q` from the
same projection group are beneficial. Treat the class list as an empirical starting point to
re-derive per model, not as a universal rule, and re-measure the tail (99% Δp) rather than
trusting mean KL alone: as the all-SYM4 row shows, a format can win on the mean and still lose
badly on the tokens that matter.

## MXFP6 and MXFP4_E4M3

Two more OCP MX formats. Both run on the same RDNA4 FP8 WMMA path as MXFP8, and neither changes
the compute path itself: the weights are expanded to exact E4M3 at tile load and consumed by the
existing `v_wmma_f32_16x16x16_fp8_fp8` kernels.

| format | weights | scale | block | bpw |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MXFP8` | E4M3 | E8M0 | 32 elements | 8.25 |
| `MXFP6` | E2M3 | E8M0 | 32 elements, 8 per 256-element super-block | 6.25 |
| `MXFP4` | E2M1 | E8M0 | 32 elements | 4.25 |
| `MXFP4_E4M3` | E2M1 | **UE4M3** | 32 elements | 4.25 |

Both expansions are lossless, which is what lets them reuse the FP8 path unchanged: every E2M3
magnitude lies exactly on the E4M3 grid, and so does every E2M1 magnitude. MXFP6's 6-bit codes are
packed little-endian at bit `6*j` into 24 bytes per sub-block, so a 256-element super-block is
`8*24 + 8 = 200` bytes.

```bash
./build-gpu/bin/llama-quantize model-bf16.gguf model-mxfp6.gguf MXFP6
python3 convert_hf_to_gguf.py --outtype mxfp6 --outfile model.gguf <model_dir>
```

### MXFP6

Measured on Qwen3.8-27B, single R9700, `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -fa 1`, same bf16 source and the same
imatrix as the MXFP8 row:

| format | bpw | size | PPL | tg128 | tg128 @ d32768 | pp512 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MXFP6` | 6.25 | 19.89 GiB | 41.4351 | 20.86 | 19.18 | 1137 |
| `MXFP8` | 8.25 | 26.25 GiB | 41.4328 | 19.29 | 18.17 | 1320 |

Perplexity differs by 0.006% while the weights are 24% smaller, and decode is about 8% faster; the
cost is prefill, which follows from the tile load. MXFP8's quants are whole E4M3 bytes and are
copied into the tile as they are, while MXFP6 has to unpack 6-bit codes first: 8 codes per 6 bytes
per 32-element sub-block, one table lookup each, into the same E4M3 bytes.

### MXFP4_E4M3 (experimental)

**`MXFP4_E4M3` is experimental, and its gain over `MXFP4` is small.** It exists to show that the
FP8 WMMA path carries any 8-bit scale codec, not as a quality upgrade.

The block is byte-for-byte the same 17-byte layout as `MXFP4` (one scale byte, 16 bytes of packed
E2M1 nibbles, 32 elements, 4.25 bpw), so only the scale codec differs. E8M0 can only land on powers
of two and therefore wastes range whenever `amax` sits between them; UE4M3 spends its three
mantissa bits tracking `amax` instead. The scale search centres on `amax / 6.0` (6.0 is the largest
E2M1 magnitude) and then refines over neighbouring UE4M3 codes.

Measured over 505 tensors of Qwen3.8-27B against the bf16 source, with both files quantized from
the same source and imatrix:

| format | weight NMSE | PPL | tg128 | pp512 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MXFP4` (E8M0) | 0.260916 | 41.8719 | 29.96 | 1475.2 |
| `MXFP4_E4M3` | 0.256890 (+1.5%) | 41.9048 | 29.86 | 1463.8 |

The NMSE gain is 1.5%, and the perplexity difference of 0.033 is far inside the +/- 0.44 error bar,
so **perplexity cannot resolve the two formats at all**. E8M0 is already close to optimal on real
per-32-block weight distributions, which are narrow; UE4M3's extra freedom only pays off with
smaller blocks. Treat the 1.5% NMSE as the honest size of the win.

Getting within 0.8% of MXFP4 on prefill took one non-obvious fix. The naive UE4M3 decode is a
branch on `exp == 0`, but scale values diverge across blocks, so both sides of the branch execute
and prefill measured 1375 t/s against MXFP4's 1475. Decoding branchlessly with bit manipulation
recovers it to 1464 t/s. A separate fix was needed because `ggml_cuda_ue4m3_to_fp32_raw` falls back
to software `ldexpf` on HIP (its hardware branches require CDNA3 or non-HIP), and this loader calls
it once per 32-element block. Branchless decode is exact for every legal code, 0x00 to 0x7E.

### imatrix support

`MXFP6`, `MXFP8` and `MXFP4_E4M3` all take an imatrix. Each has a `quantize_row_*_impl` that scores
candidate block scales by importance-weighted SSE rather than an unweighted heuristic, mirroring
what `MXFP4` and `NVFP4` already did; the weight is used instead of `x^2` in the grid search.

`MXFP6` and `MXFP8` previously had no scale search at all, just an amax-derived exponent, so the
impl adds a small E8M0 grid on top of it. The `quantize_*` entry points take the weighted path only
when `quant_weights` is non-NULL, so quantizing without an imatrix stays byte-identical to before.

Measured on the test model's 168 tensors, scored with the imatrix weights: weighted SSE 1821.6
without against 1409.2 with, i.e. 22.6% lower, and **no block in any tensor is worse** (221184 of
221184 per tensor checked). That per-block guarantee is the useful property: the impl minimises the
same objective it is scored on, so it cannot regress on that metric.

### Quantization rules

`MXFP6` mirrors `Q6_K`, matching its 256-element block, so the two share a per-tensor assignment.
For the 4-bit formats and MXFP6 the mirror re-points the 6- and 8-bit slots at the byte-coded
formats, because there is no Q type above 5 bits to reuse:

* `MXFP4`, `MXFP4_E4M3` and `NVFP4` promote what was `Q6_K` to `MXFP6` and what was `Q8_0` to `MXFP8`.
  In practice this moves `output.weight`, which every other ftype promotes.
* `MXFP4_MOE` puts experts in `MXFP4` and now sends the remaining tensors to `MXFP8` rather than `Q8_0`.
* `MXFP4_E4M3_MOE` is the same rule with experts in `MXFP4_E4M3`.

### Status

`MXFP6` passes all 13 `test-backend-ops` MUL_MAT cases and is used as a real quantization target.
`MXFP4_E4M3` is experimental: its accuracy win is 1.5% NMSE and invisible in perplexity, and it has
been measured on one model family only. Both are gated to RDNA4, like `MXFP8`; `should_use_mmq`
returns false elsewhere.

## Attribution

The I4 W4A4 path and the `Q4_0_ROCMI4` format are ported from
[ROCmFPX](https://github.com/charlie12345/ROCmFPX), which targets RDNA3.5
(gfx1151). Porting it into this tree meant re-adapting it to the current upstream MMQ
generation: ROCmFPX is written against an older MMQ built on `mmq_type_traits` with a runtime
`ncols_dst`, while upstream now selects on compile-time `ncols_dst` templates and routes
through `calc_nwarps` / `calc_rows_per_block`. The loader, the byte-interleaved nibble
packing, the LDS stride, the `vec_dot` and the per-tile configuration were all re-derived for
that structure. RDNA4 also has the K = 32 form of the instruction, so a single
`v_wmma_i32_16x16x32_iu4` is issued where ROCmFPX calls the K = 16 form twice.

The MXFP4 prefill path is ported from DeadCode's
[vllm-radiance](https://codeberg.org/StillDeadcode/vllm-radiance) and its `libr4d` kernel
library, which bring vLLM up on the R9700 through the fp8 WMMA tensor core. That side is
Triton/CUDA, so the kernels were re-derived against `ggml-cuda` rather than copied: what
carried over is the organization - expand the e2m1 weights to e4m3 once at repack, fold the
MX block exponent into the weight, then stage the weight tile through LDS while reading the
activation straight from global as A fragments. The shape policy, the repack cache, the
fused swiglu quantize and the integration into `ggml_cuda_mul_mat_q` are specific to this
tree. The `radiance_mxfp4_fp8_gemm_folded` and `_decode` variants are also ported from
libr4d, and the subnormal handling in the exponent fold was added here after measuring that
the truncated form zeroed channels on layer 58.

The ROCmFP4 / ROCmFPx family that the ROCmFPX port originally brought along (Q4_0_ROCMFP4,
Q4_0_ROCMFP4_FAST, Q3_0/Q2_0/Q6_0/Q8_0_ROCMFPX) has been removed: none of it is used by the
W4A4 work and its MMVQ paths were incomplete here.

## Description

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM (and VLM) inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on
a wide range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)
- Vulkan and SYCL backend support
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

The `llama.cpp` project is build on top of the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.
